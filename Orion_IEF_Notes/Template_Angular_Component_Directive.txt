HTML is the language of the Angular template. Almost all HTML syntax is valid template syntax. 
Except the <script> tag, which is a notable exception; it is forbidden, eliminating the risk of script injection attacks.


The HTML can pretty much be extended with "components" and "directives" which appear as  "new elements" and "new attributes".

<h4>myClick is an event on the custom ClickDirective:</h4>
<button (myClick)="clickMessage=$event" clickable>click with myClick</button>
{{clickMessage}}
If the target event name, myClick fails to match an element event or an output property of ClickDirective, Angular reports an "unknown directive" error.

You can change the property of Component and do inline assignment

(myClick)="clickMessage=$event" 
or
(myClick)="processClick()"

processClick(event){
clickMessage=$event;
}
